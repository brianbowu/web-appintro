    <p>You may access parts of the Services for free, and other services and products require payment of subscription and/or other fees (“Paid Content”). Fees charged may be one-time payments or automatically renewing payments as described in more detail in the respective Services. </p>
    <p>Please note that If you want to make a purchase in the application, you may do this with the help of payment system provided by AppStore (managed by Apple) and integrated into the apps.

    <p class="bold">TRIALS</p>
    <p>When you subscribe for Paid Content, we may from time to time offer a trial period (“Trial Period”) without payment or at a reduced rate. This may vary depending on promotions, type of subscription and the term you select at the time of purchase. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial Period and may cancel or change the Trial Period at any time without notice and liability within the limits permitted by applicable law. </p>
    <p>We may require you to provide your valid payment information to start the Trial Period. By providing this information, you agree that unless you cancel your paid subscription prior to the end of the Trial Period, we may automatically begin charging you for such Paid Content you subscribed to on the first day after the end of the Trial Period on a monthly or other recurring basis notified to you, until you cancel your subscription to Paid Content (turn off automatic renewal from your account settings or via the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store). If you do not want to be charged, you must cancel your subscription to such Paid Content before the end of the Trial Period. If you cancel your subscription to Paid Content, your Account will only have access to those parts of our Services that you may access for free.</p>
    <p class="bold">RENEWALS AND CANCELLATIONS</p>
    <p>If you choose to sign up for an auto-renewable subscription for Paid Content, you understand that and authorise that your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period and that payment for the renewal period is automatically charged from you using the payment information you have provided, unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. You can cancel your auto-renewing subscription to Paid Content purchased from your iTunes Account Settings or by contacting our support. </p>
    <p>Except as specifically provided otherwise, any payments are always FINAL and NON-REFUNDABLE.</p>
